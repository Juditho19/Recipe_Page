# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). This project helped me practise HTML and CSS by recreating a clean, responsive recipe layout based on a real-world design.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the recipe page on desktop and mobile
- See the correct layout, spacing, fonts, and colours as in the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practise writing clean HTML and structuring styles clearly. I learned:

- How to use `::marker` to customise list numbers and bullets
- How to use media queries to adjust spacing and layout for smaller screens
- How to create a responsive image that behaves differently on desktop vs mobile
- Better understanding of padding, margin, and section separation

Example of a mobile-first adjustment:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .recipe-container {
    margin: 0;
    border-radius: 0%;
  }
}
```


### Continued development

Continued development
I want to continue improving my skills in:

-Creating even more flexible responsive layouts
- Improving accessibility (ARIA roles, contrast, keyboard nav)
- Exploring how to add more interactivity with JavaScript in future projects
